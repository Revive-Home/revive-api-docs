Use this page to understand which third-party systems Revive integrates with, why they exist, where the integration is implemented, and what you need to operate it.

## Architecture overview

- **Core system of record**
  - `revive-api` uses Firebase Admin (`firebase-admin`) for Firestore and Cloud Storage.
  - `revive-admin`, `revive-dashboard`, and `revive-mobile` use Firebase client SDKs for auth + Firestore + storage access.
- **External system of record (CRM)**
  - HubSpot is used for CRM objects and workflows (contacts, deals, custom objects).
- **Common data flows**
  - Webhook-driven: third parties send events into `revive-api` endpoints under `/v1/webhooks/*`.
  - API pull: `revive-api` fetches property/valuation data from external providers on demand.
  - Client analytics/monitoring: frontends initialize analytics/monitoring vendors in their app roots.
