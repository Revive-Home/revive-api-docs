## What it is

Revive uses multiple property data providers to support valuation and analysis.

## Why we use it

Using multiple providers improves coverage and allows Revive to generate valuation ranges and enrichment even when a single provider is missing data.

## Data flow

- `revive-api` fetches provider data on demand.
- Results are stored in Firestore for caching.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-api`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

- `/v1/avm/`
- `revive-api/src/automated-valuation-models/avm.service.ts`
- `revive-api/src/utils/estated/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/lib/houseCanary/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/lib/rentcast/index.ts`
- `revive-api/src/lib/apify/index.ts`

## Operational notes

- Provider outages and rate limits may reduce completeness of results.
- Treat caching behavior as part of the API contract (changes can impact latency and provider costs).
