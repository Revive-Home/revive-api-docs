## What this page is

This is the landing page for the auto-generated API reference. It’s written for internal engineers working across `revive-api`, `revive-admin`, `revive-dashboard`, and `revive-mobile`.

Use this page to:

- pick the right base URL for your environment
- confirm authentication requirements
- copy/paste a first request
- understand basic conventions (errors, pagination)

## Base URLs

The API reference is generated from `openapi.json`, which defines these servers:

- Production: `https://revive-api-v2-production.herokuapp.com`
- Staging: `https://revive-api-v2-staging.herokuapp.com`
- Local: `http://localhost:3001`

Paths are typically versioned under `/v1` and `/v2`.

## Authentication

Most endpoints require a Firebase JWT passed via the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <firebase_jwt>
```

In the OpenAPI spec this is represented as `BearerAuth` with `bearerFormat: Firebase JWT`.

## Make your first request

Start with the unauthenticated health check:

```bash
curl -sS https://revive-api-v2-production.herokuapp.com/health
```

Then try an authenticated endpoint from the sidebar (any endpoint with a lock icon) using your Firebase JWT.

## Conventions

### Errors

- `401` typically indicates a missing/invalid token
- `403` typically indicates the token is valid but the caller lacks required permissions
- `404` is returned for unknown routes as:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "invalid endpoint",
  "code": 404
}
```

### Pagination

Pagination is endpoint-specific. Check each endpoint’s query parameters (for example, `limit`) in the reference.
