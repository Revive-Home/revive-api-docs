## What is Revive?

Revive is the platform powering Revive Home experiences. This documentation is the source of truth for how Revive’s backend API behaves, how to integrate with it, and how to work in the codebase.

Use this site if you’re:

- integrating with the Revive API
- debugging API behavior across environments
- developing on Revive services locally
