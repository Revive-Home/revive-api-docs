## What it is

Address verification integrations power address autocomplete and address normalization.

## Why we use it

Normalizing addresses early during intake reduces downstream data quality issues and improves matching against property/valuation providers.

## Data flow

- Frontend apps perform autocomplete/verification during intake and editing flows.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-admin`
- `revive-dashboard`
- `revive-mobile`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

- `revive-admin/hooks/useSmartyStreets.ts`
- `revive-dashboard/src/hooks/useSmartyStreets.ts`

## Operational notes

- Address normalization should be consistent across products to avoid fragmented records.
