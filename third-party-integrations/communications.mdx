## What it is

Communications integrations support:

- SMS/MMS delivery
- Internal operational notifications

## Why we use it

To send user-facing messaging and keep internal teams informed of events.

## Data flow

- `revive-api` sends messages to communications providers.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-api`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

- `revive-api/src/lib/twilio/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/lib/twilio/sendMessage.js`
- `revive-api/src/lib/slack/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/lib/slack/sendMessage.js`

## Operational notes

- Normalize phone numbers consistently before sending.
- Prefer structured metadata in internal notifications so they’re searchable.
