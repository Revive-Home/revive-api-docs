## What it is

Inbound webhook endpoints allow third parties and partner systems to push events into Revive.

## Why we use it

Webhooks provide near real-time event ingestion without polling.

## Data flow

- Third parties send events into `revive-api` endpoints under `/v1/webhooks/*`.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-api`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

Common webhook endpoints:

- `/v1/webhooks/affiliate-partners`
- `/v1/webhooks/gvg`
- `/v1/webhooks/website-case-study`

HubSpot and PandaDoc webhook endpoints are documented on their respective pages.

Code modules:

- `revive-api/src/webhooks/webhooks.routes.js`
- `revive-api/src/webhooks/webhooks.service.js`

## Operational notes

- Webhook handlers should be idempotent and safe to retry.
- Prefer validation at the boundary to reject malformed payloads early.
