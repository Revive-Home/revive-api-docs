title: "Release notes"
description: "What changed across the Revive platform"
---

Use this section to track changes across the Revive platform that are released to **Production**, including:

- revive-dashboard
- revive-mobile
- revive-admin
- revive-api

Create one entry per release version (for example, `v1.12.0`).

Mintlify does not automatically generate or filter release notes for you. To keep this accurate, add only items that were deployed to **Production**.
