## What it is

Firebase provides the core platform services used across the Revive applications:

- Firestore for operational data
- Cloud Storage for file uploads
- Firebase Auth for user identity
- FCM for push notifications

## Why we use it

Firebase is the primary system of record for the Revive platform and enables real-time client experiences.

## Data flow

- `revive-api` uses the Firebase Admin SDK for privileged access.
- `revive-admin`, `revive-dashboard`, and `revive-mobile` use Firebase client SDKs.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-api`
- `revive-admin`
- `revive-dashboard`
- `revive-mobile`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

- `revive-api/src/lib/firebase/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/utils/push-notifications.js`
- `revive-api/src/media/media.service.js`
- `revive-admin/utils/firebase.ts`
- `revive-dashboard/src/utils/firebase.ts`

## Operational notes

- Treat Firestore schemas as shared contracts across all clients.
- Keep migrations and backfills in `revive-api` when possible so all clients converge on the same data model.
