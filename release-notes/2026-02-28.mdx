description: "How Revive platform release notes are generated"
---

This page was created as a placeholder when setting up release notes.

Real release notes are published as versioned pages (for example, `v1.12.0`) and are generated from merged pull requests across:

- `revive-dashboard`
- `revive-admin`
- `revive-mobile`
- `revive-api`

Only pull requests with the `released` label should be included.

## Generate a new release notes entry

1. In GitHub, open `Revive-Home/revive-api-docs`.
2. Go to **Actions**.
3. Run **Generate release notes**.
4. Enter a `release_version` like `v1.12.0`.
5. Optionally set `since` to limit results (recommended for the first run).
6. Merge the generated PR.

After your first versioned release notes entry is generated, you can delete this page.
