## What it is

Payments integrations support payment processing and billing workflows.

## Why we use it

To process payments securely and handle payment lifecycle events.

## Data flow

- Inbound: payment providers can send webhook events to `revive-api`.
- Outbound: `revive-api` calls provider APIs to create sessions/intents and reconcile state.

## Owner repo(s)

- `revive-api`

## Relevant modules/endpoints

- `revive-api/src/lib/stripe/index.js`
- `revive-api/src/payments/payments.controller.js`

## Operational notes

- Webhook handlers should be idempotent and safe to retry.
